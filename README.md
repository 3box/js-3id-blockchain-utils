```

Use the library to create and verify links:
```js
const proof = createLink('0x123abc...', ethereumProvider)

## Contributing
If you want to add support for a new blockchain to 3ID this is the place to do so. In order to do this start by adding a file for the given blockchain with the path: `src/blockchains/<blockchain-name>.js`. This module needs to export three functions; `typeDetector`, `createLink`, and `validateLink`. Please see `src/blockchains/ethereum.js` for an example.

You also need to add an `ADDRESS_TYPE` for the blockchain address scheme. Do this in the `src/constants.js` file.

Finally add support for your blockchain in `src/index.js`. Simply add it to the `handlers` array and the `typeDetectors` array.

### Test
Test the code by running:
```
$ npm test
```
